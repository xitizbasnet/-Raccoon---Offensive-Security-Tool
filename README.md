 Raccoon - Offensive Security Tool

A raccoon is a tool made for reconnaissance and information gathering with an emphasis on simplicity.

How it works 
It does everything from fetching DNS records, retrieving WHOIS information, obtaining TLS data, detecting WAF presence and up to threaded dir busting and subdomain enumeration. Every scan outputs to a corresponding file.

Raccoon scans 
As most of Raccoon scans are independent and do not rely on each other's results, it utilizes Python's asyncio to run most scans asynchronously.

anonymous routing 
Raccoon supports Tor/proxy for anonymous routing.
